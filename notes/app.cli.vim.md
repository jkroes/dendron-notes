vim keybinding support is built-into Obsidian. To enable it, check Options > Editor > Advanced > Vim key bindings.

If you want to configure Obsidian's version of vim, say by adding normal mode bindings to commands (line folding, anyone?), check out [this plugin](https://github.com/esm7/obsidian-vimrc-support)
