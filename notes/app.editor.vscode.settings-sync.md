If you notice that settings aren't syncing between your computers, check Output > Log (Settings Sync). If there is a line that reads, "... Auto Sync: Suspended until auth token is available," you might need to sign back into GitHub through vscode. In the lower-right corner of vscode is a profile icon where you can sign in.
