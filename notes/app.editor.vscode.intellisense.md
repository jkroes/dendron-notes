IntelliSense
: A general term for various code editing features including: code completion, parameter info, quick info, and member lists. 

IntelliSense "suggestions" (code completion candidates) are triggered by CTRL+SPACE (Trigger Suggest).

While suggestions are visible, CTRL+SPACE (toggleSuggestionDetails) shows a documentation popup.

CTRL+SHIFT+SPACE / CMD+SHIFT+SPACE (Trigger Parameter Hints) can trigger a signature popup, but some other apps on MacOS seem to be capturing the input and requiring MacOS to call Trigger Parameter Hints from the command pallette.
