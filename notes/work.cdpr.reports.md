# Report workflow

1. If you previously submitted a report for edits, look for it in [Returned for Edits](file:///C:/Users/jkroes/OneDrive%20-%20California%20Department%20of%20Pesticide%20Regulation/Reports_for_Review/Returned_for_Edits)
2. Keep track changes on unless Maziar asks you to disable it!
3. Make edits to report.
4. Drop the report in [Routed to Maziar](file:///C:/Users/jkroes/OneDrive%20-%20California%20Department%20of%20Pesticide%20Regulation/Reports_for_Review/Routed_to_Maziar)
5. Assign Maziar a task.
6. Shoot Maziar an email.
