[Proxy notes](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/ns09dicjf4pz3lcu8aowbfa/) are note representations of a URI (currently only URLs). Like a markdown link, the [Go to](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/3d4lr7glouhrvpd7y9t76bf/) command launches the URL instead of the note, but you get the following benefits over a markdown link:

- organize external resources in a hierarchical structure using dot notation
- look them up using Lookup
- create links to them using the wikilink syntax in other notes
- open the proxy notes and check their backlinks
- and refactor them

Note that the `Go to note` command still visits the proxy note.
