https://forum.obsidian.md/t/pdf-zotero-obsidian-current-state-and-collaboration-for-the-one-plugin/34372 is a discussion of the various plugins.

I am using https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration/blob/main/docs/PDF%20Annotations.md. It is documented here https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration/tree/9bf82085b66415bca1bac8456fa6b7df296b4076/docs.

The template for creating a literature note is [[app.note.obsidian.template.zotero]]. It uses the [[language.prog.js.template.nunjucks]] templating system.

When editing/writing the template, use the command Zotero Integration: Data Explorer to view the data available from a sample item and how it would display using the current template. My template is based on https://medium.com/@alexandraphelan/an-academic-workflow-zotero-obsidian-56bf918d51ab. They do not explain everything, and they appear to have an older version of Obsidian, a different theme, and/or custom callouts. (Compare the text in their template to the callout text in the image.) Also see https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Use+callouts and https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-desktop-connector-import-templates/36310/2 (user-contirbuted custom callouts).

TODO Change the annotation links from links to the PDF to actual links to the page in Zotero.

WARNING: Creating a literature note for the same item twice seems to simply overwrite the old literature note.
