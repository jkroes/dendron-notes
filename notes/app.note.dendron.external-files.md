[This](file:///D:) is a file link to a directory using an absolute path. vscode chokes on it, as it chokes on any non-text file. Absolute filepath links to text files can be opened, but only within vscode. Enter dendron.

`Dendron: Go to` opens non-text files with a default application. Despite what is written in [[rfc 38|app.note.dendron.proxy-note.rfc38]] and [[proxy-note|app.note.dendron.proxy-note]], this feature has already been implemented for links (but not for proxy notes, I assume).
